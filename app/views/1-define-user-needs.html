      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>Have you carried out user research in the form of multiple interviews or observations of the users?</li>
        <li>Do you have a thorough knowledge of who your users are?</li>
        <li>Does your evidence support your understanding of your users’ needs?</li>

        What good looks like
      </h2>
      <p>
        The team/department have carried out user research in the form of multiple interviews to find out who the user is and what they need. In order to meet all the user’s needs the project or programme will need to employ/assign people with the right range
        of skills and experience. The team should continue to do user research at key points throughout the project and programme to refine their deliverables and help keep the project or programme on track. At the end of the project or programme it is
        useful to do a user research round up of the findings in case they can be used by other teams as part of their research.
