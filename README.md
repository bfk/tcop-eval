# Tech Code of Practice Evaluation Tool

Use this service to:

- Evaluate a technical platform to determine if it is being developed in accordance with the Technology Code of Practice
- Create a summary of your Code of Practice analysis that can be shared with others or start conversations
- Conduct an internal evaluation of a platform in advance of a Spend Control or other assurance process
- Fully evaluating a programme can take some time, but if you have a solid understanding of the programme and access to documentation, this self-evaluation tool can be completed in about 10 minutes.

##Â Before you start

You will want to have a good knowledge of the details of the technical platform and probably access to project or commercial documentation about it. You might also choose to conduct this evaluation more interactively, through discussion with people working on procuring or developing the platform.

Assurance teams and others might also use this tool to create a snapshot of their current view of your platform and to provide recommendations for ongoing improvement.
